<h4><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h4>
<p><b>FVSOnline</b> is an interface to the <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/fvs/" target="_blank">
Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS)</a>. FVS takes a file of commands and
input data and produces predictions of forest conditions in the
future. This interface is used to set up the file of commands, run
FVS, and then explore the outputs. The input data are measurements of
trees stored in an input database. Tools for installing and editing
that database are included.</p>
<p>These instructions assume that you are already familiar with FVS.

Press here</a> to view an essential background manual. 
</p>
<p>The interface was designed to run in a true client/server
configuration, whereby the data and software are stored on a server
and the user interaction is through a web browser. However, the
software can also be installed on personal computer or in a 
<a href="https://www.citrix.com/" target="_blank">Citrix</a>
(or similar) system. The interaction is still through a web browser,
but the software, inputs and outputs, are all stored on the "personal computer".
This configuration is called FVSOnlocal. The system was built using 
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank"><b>R</b></a>, <a 
href="http://shiny.rstudio.com/" target="_blank"><b>Shiny</b></a>,  
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank"><b>SQLite3</b></a>, and many other
R packages. For more information on the
software and supporting software requirements see the 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/open-fvs/wiki/FVSOnline/" target="_blank">
wiki about FVSOnline software</a>.</p>
<p><i>Hints</i> for first time users:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Use the default input database
	while learning, load your own data once you're comfortable using the
	interface. Note that there is a command under the <b>Tools</b> menu
	that lets you delete all runs and related outputs so you can easily
	start fresh with your own data. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in">Use default settings and options
	until you need to change them. 
	</p>
	<li><p>Exploring the system is the best way to learn while reading
	this documentation might be helpful after you have some experience.

</ul>
<h4><a name="tmruns"></a>Runs</h4>
<p>When the <b>Runs</b>
menu is selected the screen is divided into two regions, left and
right. The left side contains the <b>Selected
run</b>
list and buttons to create new runs, reload a selected run, save it, duplicate it 
(more on that later), or delete it. The title of the selected run is displayed in a text box
(you can change it to whatever you wish) and the run <b>Contents</b>
are listed below. There are buttons and other tools below the
<b>Contents</b> that are <a href="#leftSideRun">described below</a>.</p>
<p>The right side contains a secondary menu, used to select
<b>Stands</b> and add <b>Components</b>. Stands are the simulation
units defined in the 
<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/ftp/fvs/docs/gtr/DBSUserGuide.pdf" target="_blank">
input database</a> and components are sets of 
<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/ftp/fvs/docs/gtr/EssentialFVS.pdf" target="_blank">
FVS keywords</a> (also called commands) that that instruct FVS to invoke
options or to simulate management activities. The stands and
components will be added to the <b>Contents</b> list on the left. 
</p>
<p>The first step in building a run is to select the FVS variant you wish to
use. Only those stands that can be run with the selected variant will be listed
as possible choices. Select one or more groups and then select the stands from
the selected groups. You can add individually selected stands or all the stands
from selected groups using the buttons found below the list of stands. </p>
<p>Once stands are added, you can make a run using the Run tab on the right end
of the second level menu bar. Alternatively, before you make the run, you can
add run <i>components</i> control the simulation. Or do both, make a run and
then change it and run it again. Or, make a run and duplicate it, then modify
the duplicate. Once you make both runs, you can compare the outputs of the two
(or several, as you desire).</p>
<p>Note that you can add the same stand more than once and each is considered a
replicate. This can be done by selecting and adding the same stand more than
once or by specifying the number of replicates in the input box found below the
list of available stands. You can also specify a set
of relative weights of each replicate. These weights are used to modify the
stand sampling weights specified in the input database. Often these sampling
weights are stand sizes or the size of the land area represented by the stand.
The set of weights you enter is <i>recycled</i> if necessary so that each
replicate gets a weight. For example, if you say you want 5 replications of each
stand, and you enter 1,2 for the weights, the resulting set will be 1,2,1,2,1.
The logic includes a <i>normalization</i> step such that each weight is divided
by the sum of the weights. Note that this normalization happens when the run is
made using the Run tab. The normalized weights are then multiplied by the
sampling weight entered in the database and the results are entered into FVS so
that the sampling weights for each replicate are correctly reported in the FVS
output. Lastly note that there is no way to modify the weights once they are 
entered. If you make a mistake, delete the entered stands and then redo the 
process of adding them to the run.</p>
<p>New <b>Components</b> are added by selecting them, filling out the
associated form, and then saving them. Components are accessed by
first selecting component type:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Management</b> for specifying
	management actions 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Modifiers</b> for specify
	changes in the FVS predictions 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Event Monitor</b> for adding FVS output
	variables you define using FVS functions
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Economic</b> for setting parameters
	of the Economic Extension of FVS
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><b>Keywords</b> for direct
	access to all FVS keywords 
	</p>
	<li><p><b>Custom</b> to make and use custom component sets you build or
	load (also know as .kcp files). 
	</p>
</ul>
<p>The <b>Time</b> scope of a simulation is automatically set to 50
or 100 years in 5 or 10 years cycles, both depending on the variant.
The parameters of time can be edited and specific years you want
included in the simulation can be specified as a list of years (separate
the years with a space).</p>
<p><b>Select Outputs</b> is used to select which output tables you want FVS 
to generate. A few, like the FVS_Summary statistics table, are automaticlly generated
every run. The others are selected using the check boxes displayed. You can
get a short description of each table using the Describe tables tool at the
bottom of the checkboxes. Note that FVSOnline the tree lists to generate
stand and stock tables; if you desire them, then check the tree lists box.
</p>
<p><b>Run</b> simulations while you wait (great for under 20 stands
or so), or in the background as a separate process. Use the
checkboxes to specify sets of outputs without having to know the
keywords needed to get the outputs you desire. You can also select
alternative run scripts; these are used to implement alternative
models within the FVS framework. Note that when you rerun a run, the
interface clears the output from the previous time you made the run
so that the output database contains the most recently generated
output. If you use the <i>Wait for run</i> option,
the interface will scan the FVS output file for error messages and
display any it finds in the interface. The <i>Run in
background</i> option does not provide that service. However, 
there is a download button useful for downloading the FVS “.out” file.</p>
</ul>
<p id="leftSideRun">Here
are more details on the left side elements when <b>Runs</b>
is selected in the main manu.
</p>
<p>The Duplicate command found near the top of the left side deserves
some explanation. Lets say you have made a simulation for a
collection of stands using set of components and you wish to make
another run with different components or different settings in
existing components (for example, setting different residual
densities on thinning options). Your idea is that you want to compare
the results. In this case you should <i>duplicate</i>
the first run, giving the duplicate a new name and then edit the
duplicate. You can run and rerun any of the runs as often as you wish
and you can compare the outputs after the simulations are run.</p>
<p>The
buttons found below the Contents list can be used to remove a stand,
group, or component. If a component is removed it is added to a paste
list. To paste one of these components into the run, first select the
component you want to paste, then select a stand, group, or another
component in the Contents list. The pasted component will be added to
the selected stand or group, or directly after the selected
component. You can also edit existing components or convert
components from there formatted state that allows them to be edited
using the same form used to create them or they can be converted to
<i>freeform</i>
that allows them to be directly modified (most useful for experts who
know the <a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/ftp/fvs/docs/gtr/keyword.pdf" target="_blank">FVS
keywords</a>). Sometimes components are in the <i>freeform</i>
state from the beginning.

<h4><a name="tmout"></a>View Outputs</h4>
<p><b>View Outputs</b> after you make one or more runs. There are two required
steps, the first is to <b>Load</b> outputs for the runs and output tables you 
want to then <b>Explore</b>. For example, say you
have made two runs and you want to compare their projections. In that
case, you would select them both and then select the database tables
you wish to explore. If you wish, you can limit the database columns you want to 
explore but the default is to select all the columns from selected tables. The system
automatically merges (joins) the data from the selected tables so you
can explore variables from different tables when you <b>Explore</b> the
data you selected. The data can be displayed as <b>Tables</b>
or <b>Graphs</b> depending on the selections on the right-hand
secondary menu.</p>
<p>Composite summary statistics tables are created for the runs (table name: CmpSummary, 
CmpSummary2, or the "East" versions of these) where the composites are weighted averages 
of corresponding tables grouped by <b>management ids</b> (not by run because  
more than one run can have the same management id, 
more than one management id can be within one run, or both). 
If treelist tables exist, stand and stock tables are also created (table name StdStk; 
CmpStdStk for the composites, also grouped by management id).</p>
<p><b>Explore Data </b>menu item is used to further control which
data are being explored. Use the selection tools on the left to limit
the data used in the tables or graphs to specific runs, groups,
stands, management identification codes (set when you make a run),
years, species, and DBHClasses. You can also turn variables on or off
limiting the columns being displayed in tables and those available
for graphing. 
</p>
<p>In summary, the two basic steps are to (1) Load the runs and FVS-generated 
output tables, and (2) Explore those data as Tables or Graphs.
</p>
<p>When <b>Tables</b> are displayed, you can use tools to change a categorical
variable (such as stand or management identifications) into a set of columns and display
a variable’s value under that column. Tables can be download as .xlsx or .csv
files (easily opened using Excel or other spreadsheet programs). Note that the
number of lines displayed in the table is limited, however, when the table is
downloaded, all lines are included (for .xlsx up to 1048576 rows). 
</p>
<p>The <b>Graphs</b> menu item on the right provides
access to graphing tools that operate on the data displayed in the
table. FVSOnline contains limited logic to preselect settings
depending on the data being analyzed. Your changes are kept until you
go back are reselect the data you want to analyze. The best way to
learn how the graphing tool works is to experiment. Note that making
some selections sometimes changes others. For example, if you change
the vertical facet to the same setting as the horizontal facet, your
selection will be automatically adjusted to <i>None</i>.
Also note that when there are too many levels for a variable—such
as too many stands—then the system blocks the use of the variable
for faceting. Similar limits control the size of the legend that is
created when you select a <i>Plot by</i> variable.  
If you want to keep a graph you can cut-and-paste it from your
browser to some other software, or add it to a custom report,
described next. If you want high resolution graphs, or otherwise 
customize the apperance of a graph, then <i>Show</i> more controls and
change the values as needed. Note that there are several ways to customize graphs.
</p>
<p style="font-variant: normal; font-style: normal"><b>Reports</b> provides access to
a report building feature. A report is a set of
tables and graphs that are combined into a single document that can be downloaded
as a .docx file. You start (or restart)
a new report using the <i>Restart custom report</i> button.
There are buttons in the Tables and Graphs panels where you can add the currently
displayed table or graph to the report. 
</p>
<p><b>Custom Query</b> provides the ability to build and run SQL queries that run
on the output <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank">SQLite3</a>
database (the database structure is defined in the  
<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/ftp/fvs/docs/gtr/DBSUserGuide.pdf" target="_blank">
Users Guide to the Database Extension).</a> The tabular output from 
those queries is displayed as a table and data in that table can be graphed or
downloaded. 
Note that SQLite3 allows the attachment additional databases. For example, 
the input database can be attached and tables from the input can then be 
joined to tables in the output. A <i>query</i> can
actually be several queries each separated by a semicolon. They can
be stored and recovered for later use. Lastly, comments can be included in 
the query by surrounding it with /*  */ character sequences.

</p>
<h4><a name="outputTables"></a>Available output tables</h4>
<p>The tables output generated from FVS are selected prior making a run using the 
<b>Select Outputs</b> menu item under the <b>Tabs</b> tab. The available tables are 
listed below, and below this list there is a set of addition tables that describe
the detailed contents of each of the tables.
</p>
<p>FVSOnline generates some <i>composite</i> tables by taking a weighted average over
the individual stands from the selected runs you selected in the <b>Runs to consider</b> 
list box. The weights used in this calculation are the individual stand sampling weights
as specified in the input database. The names of these composite tables start with 
<b>Cmp</b> and are listed below.
</p>
<p>Computing the composites is done by grouping all the stands accross all selected
runs by unique <i>management ID</i> (which can be set in the Runs tab or by using an 
FVS Keyword). Individual stands that have the same stand ID, run using the same 
management ID, are considered replications of the stand. Prior to computing the weighted 
averages, the sampling weights for the  are adjusted by dividing each by 
the number of replications. This is a temporary adjustment that is recomputed every 
time outputs are explored. The adjusted weights are reported as the <i>SamplingWt</i>
in the FVS_Cases table (described below). Remember that the number of replications for 
each stand can change depending on how the management IDs are assigned and by which 
runs are considered. Generally, however, unique management IDs are used for each run
and when that is the case, the replication counts will not change when different runs
are selected.

</p>
<h4><a name="tmsvs"></a>SVS3d</h4>
<p>You can display two 3d images of stands if the output that support 
<a href="http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/svs.html" target="_blank">
Stand Visualization System</a> has been created (easily done by checking
SVS under the Select Outputs table). Pick a run, and within the Run, pick the stand and 
time period you wish to display. It takes some time for the images to be created 
and transferred to your browser. Once the transfer is completed, you can click 
on the image and rotate it, flip it, and zoom in and out using your mouse.
</p>
<p><a href="#contents">Back to contents</a> 
</p>
<h4><a name="tmmaps"></a>Maps</h4>
<p>You can display stand polygon boundaries of the stands in the <b>Selected Run</b> 
over a Google satellite or other map. Select an <b>Output Table</b> and a <b>Variable</b> 
from the table. When you point your mouse at a stand, a small table is displayed 
showing the values of that variable over time. You can <b>Display</b> graphs rather 
than tables. Note that if you have a very large run, it can take significant amounts of
time to generate the graphs. 
</p><p>
Note that the spatial polygons of the stand boundaries are 
required to display boundaries. However, spatial points can alternatively be loaded and
when points are provided, a red dot is displayed at the point location. 
See <b>Map data</b> under <a href="#tmin">Import Data</a>
to see now to load this spatial data.
</p><p>
If spatial data are not loaded, an attempt is made to use the Latitude and Longitude 
information from the FVS_StandInit table (failing that, the FVS_TreeInit table)
assuming WGS84 geographic coordinates are used. 
</p>
<p><a href="#contents">Back to contents</a> 
</p>
<h4><a name="tmin"></a>Import Data</h4>
<p>You can <b>Replace the existing database</b> by uploading an
FVS-Ready database that is stored as a <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/" target="_blank">SQLite3</a>
database (use the file suffix .db), as a Microsoft Access database
(.mdb or .accdb), or as an Excel (.xlsx) database where the sheet names are
the same as the target table names. The built-in training data or a blank database (and
FVS-Ready database that contains no rows but has predefined columns)
can be installed without uploading a file simply by pressing the
obvious buttons.</p>
<p>You can <b>Upload and insert new rows</b> to existing database
tables. This is done by uploading a .csv file that contains column
headings. Columns in the .csv file that are not in the existing table are added. 
Columns in the existing table that have no values in the .csv file are left
null.</p>
<p>You can <b>View and edit existing tables</b>. Use the <b>Edit</b>
mode to change values or delete rows. Make the changes and then
<b>Commit</b> them to the database. Use the <b>New rows</b> mode to
add new rows. You can limit the variables to consider in either mode;
those not considered are simply hide from view and not altered. If
you hide variables when you add new rows, the hidden variables are
given null values.</p>
<p>More information on the input and output database structure is
in the
<a href="https://www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/ftp/fvs/docs/gtr/DBSUserGuide.pdf" target="_blank">
Users Guide to the Database Extension.</a></p>
<p>You can upload <b>Map data</b> that is used to display stand polygons on top of reference
maps using the <a href="#tmmaps">Maps</a> menu item. Many file formats are
supported, <a href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html" target="_blank">see this
list</a>. To upload a map, first create a .zip file that contains a single directory (folder) 
where the coverages are stored. Then upload the .zip file and let FVSOnline try to
load the appropriate files. </p>
<p>If the .zip file contains more than one layer, you can select the one that 
contains stand polygons (the system will attempt to make a valid selection). Note that
the polygons must be identifiable by StandID but frequently the coverage data contains
this information under a different variable name. FVSOnline attempts to discover the 
correct variable to match to StandID. You can set the variable here if necessary.</p>
<p>If the geographic projection of your data is not stored with the data (usually it 
is part of the coverage data), then you can set the projection
using the provided tools. You can select a projection from the list button or just
type in the proj4 string into the text box if you know what it is. Note the the 
projection is set or reset here but the spatial data is not reprojected. 
Any needed reprojection is done automatically.</p>

<p>The <b>Refresh/copy software</b> tab has different features depending on the 
system configuration you are running. When running the <i>Online configuration</i>
(using a remote server), there are two sets of tools and when running the <i>Local
configuration</i> only the second set described below is available.</p>
The first set of tools (available only when running <i>Online</i>) allows you to 
<b>Refresh current project from system sources.</b> The FVS variants that are available 
in the active project can be refreshed you can select additional variants. There is also 
a command to refresh the interface software itself where you can pick between the production and
development versions of the interface software. Note that once a project is established, 
the software (the interface and the FVS variants) are not automatically updated when 
new software releases are made. This enables users to "freeze" the code they are using for a project 
updating it only if there is a need and desire to do so.</p>
The second set of tools (always available) allow you to 
<b>Copy data and software from a source project to target project(s)</b>. You decide
which data to copy, but note that you can not copy the runs nor the output database from
one project to another. You first select
the source and target projects and select the elements you want to copy. The selected
files are copied when you press the <b>Copy now</b> button.
