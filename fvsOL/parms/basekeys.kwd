{Specifies the maximum stand density index by species.  The value of
the maximum stand density index is an important variable in determining
stand mortality, and the normal stocking for automatic thinnings.

Maximum SDI for a stand is computed as a weighted average of the SDI maximums
for each species in the stand.  The weight for a species is calculated as
the total basal area for the species divided by total basal area in the stand.

Maximum stand SDI is used in all variants to determine normal stocking for
automatic thinnings.  See the variant overview to determine if SDI maximums are used 
to determine mortality in the variant you are using. 

Specifically, SDI is computed as follows:
     T = b1*(QMD**(-1.605))
Where:
     T = trees per acre
     b1 = constant derived from user entered SDI maximum.
     QMD = quadratic mean stand diameter.(If QMD = 10.0, then T = SDI)

For any particular species, this keyword remains in effect until a 
subsequent use of the keyword changes the priority for that species.
Keyword order may be important.  If a SPECPREF keyword is specified for
the same year as a thinning, the species preference will affect the 
thinning only if the SPECPREF keyword appears before the thinning keyword
in the keyword sequence.

This ensures that the trees per acre expansions are representative

For example, if at every point in a survey three 1/300-acre plots

small-tree plots is 3/300 acre, which reduces to 1/100 acre.

Caution: Do not confuse multiple small-tree plots with a sampling
design where different size small trees are recorded using different
size fixed-plots.  In the latter case the areas should NOT be added
together.  Instead, the tree counts for all small trees in the tree
data will need to be modified to represent a single plot size, and

description{sn ls ne cs}:
{YardLoss allows the user to designate a portion of a harvest to be
left in the woods. It is used in conjunction with the Fire and Fuels
Extension to compute fuel loadings and dead tree statistics.

You create a YardLoss keyword followed by a Thin keyword or management
action.  The YardLoss applies to "cuts" that follow and are scheduled
for the same year.

Using this keyword, you change the models assumptions regarding the
amount of "cut" that is left in the stand.  For example, if you specify
that all of the cut stems are left, then the cut trees will be removed
from the live tree list, those trees will be reported as "removed
trees", but their biomass will be included in the dead surface fuel
estimates.

Of trees that are not removed, you can specify the proportion that are
felled.  If none are felled, then the trees are deemed snags.
Therefore, you can create snags by "cutting" trees, leaving them in
the stand, and then specifying that they are not "down".

You can control the proportion of unmerchantable material (small trees,
topwood, branchwood) that is left in the stand.  This biomass becomes
surface fuel for the Fire and Fuels Extension.}
