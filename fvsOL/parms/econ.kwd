Revenues accrued during a cycle when the Pretend keyword is active are
reported only for that cycle, i.e., these revenues are not carried

application of revenues and interpretation of prices and diameters.  If
unit-of-measure is tree/acre harvested, or 1000 board-feet/acre for harvested

description:
{Requests that economic benefits and costs be calculated for a
hypothetical (i.e., pretend) stand harvest.  When Pretend is active,
harvest costs and revenues are computed, but removals are not made from
FVS tree records.  When active, harvest costs and revenues are reported
in the cycle in which they occur but are not accumulated across cycles.
The Pretend keyword is effective only when active at the beginning year
of a cycle, because FVS conducts all harvests in the first year of a cycle.
Only harvest costs and revenues are affected by this keyword.
Pretend activation can be turned on and off during the simulation by
setting different activation times and durations.  If multiple Pretend
keywords are entered specifying the same year or cycle, the keyword
specified last will be used.

If Pretend keywords are imbedded in an event monitor sequence, activation
year is interpreted as years from the time the event is true, or in other
words, a lag time (e.g., 5).

Note: The Pretend keyword acts in addition to the FVS MINHARV keyword;
if MINHARV is specified, harvest must meet MINHARV conditions in
order to be simulated in a pretend fashion.}
